# Great Approximator

## Overview  
The task is to implement a **server-client game** called *Great Approximator*.  
Players (clients) try to approximate a hidden polynomial function  

$$
f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{N} a_i x^i
$$


over integer points `0..K` by incrementally adding values at chosen positions.  
The server manages the game, coefficients, and scoring, while clients submit their moves.  

The player’s score is the **sum of squared deviations** between their approximation `f^` and the actual polynomial `f(x)`, plus penalties for protocol violations.  

## Components  
- **Server (`approx-server`)**  
  - Accepts TCP connections (IPv4/IPv6).  
  - Assigns polynomial coefficients to each new player.  
  - Validates moves, updates approximations, applies penalties, and broadcasts results.  
  - Ends the game after `M` valid moves with a `SCORING` message.  

- **Client (`approx-client`)**  
  - Connects to the server via TCP.  
  - Identifies itself with a `HELLO` message.  
  - Receives polynomial coefficients (`COEFF`).  
  - Sends moves (`PUT point value`).  
  - Operates in two modes:  
    - **Automatic (`-a`)** → Implements a strategy better than random.  
    - **Manual** → Reads moves (`point value`) from standard input.  

## Protocol  
- Text-based TCP messages ending with `\r\n`.  
- Examples:  
  - `HELLO player1\r\n`  
  - `COEFF 2 -1 0.5\r\n`  
  - `PUT 3 4.5\r\n`  
  - `STATE 4.5 0 5.75 0\r\n`  
  - `SCORING alice 12.34 bob 45.67\r\n`  

- Error handling:  
  - Invalid moves → `BAD_PUT` (+10 penalty).  
  - Out-of-order requests → `PENALTY` (+20 penalty).  
  - Invalid input lines → diagnostic `ERROR` messages.  

## Game Flow  
1. Client connects → sends `HELLO`.  
2. Server responds with polynomial coefficients (`COEFF`).  
3. Client sends `PUT` commands to approximate polynomial values.  
4. Server updates state and replies with `STATE`.  
5. After `M` valid moves, server sends `SCORING` and resets.  

## Implementation Notes  
- Must be in **C or C++** using **sockets** (no external networking libs).  
- Both server and client must handle IPv4 and IPv6.  
- Server handles multiple clients concurrently (non-blocking).  
- Floating-point operations may use `double`.  
- Build system: `Makefile` with rules for `approx-server`, `approx-client`, and `clean`.  

## Deliverables  
- Source code only (no binaries).  
- Archive in `.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z`, or `.tgz`.  
- After `make`, the executables `approx-server` and `approx-client` must be produced.
