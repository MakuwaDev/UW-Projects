2. **Clustering (7 pts):** Apply clustering methods with appropriate distance measures, choose variables and transformations, and determine the optimal number of clusters using silhouette score.  
3. **Classification (10 pts):** Build and evaluate models predicting whether an employee has higher education (â‰¤2), with cross-validation and feature importance analysis.  
4. **Regression (10 pts):** Construct regression models predicting base salary, using proper train/test splits, variable selection, and discussion of variable roles.
