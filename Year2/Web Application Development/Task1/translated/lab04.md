## Task

The task is to install Tailwind CSS in your project and use it to style a webpage.  
A good idea would be to show how the page from the first block could look with Tailwind styling, but that’s optional — you may style any webpage you like.  

## Requirements

### Basic tasks
Each of these is quite simple:

1. Install Tailwind CSS in the project.  
   - Install `npm` and `npx`, then follow the [Tailwind CLI installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).  
2. Use classes like `text-sky-500` to change text color.  
   - Add at least **3 different text colors**.  
   - Ensure that link colors are different from normal text colors.  
   - [Docs: Text color](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/text-color).  
3. Use classes like `bg-sky-500` to change background color.  
   - Add at least **3 different background colors**.  
   - [Docs: Background color](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/background-color).  
4. Demonstrate the use of background effects (`shadow`).  
   - [Docs: Box shadow](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/box-shadow).  
5. Use the `table-auto` class for table styling.  
   - [Docs: Table layout](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/table-layout).  
6. Add `animate-ping` to one element on the page.  
   - [Docs: Animation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/animation).  

### Intermediate tasks

1. *(Optional, but recommended)* Configure **Visual Studio Code** for Tailwind CSS.  
   - [Docs: Editor setup](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup).  
   > **Tip:** In Tailwind v4.0, no `tailwind.config.js` file is created by default.  
   > The **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense** extension requires this file, so you can simply create an empty `tailwind.config.js` in your project root.  
2. Demonstrate the difference between `flex-row` and `flex-col`.  
   - [Docs: Flex direction](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/flex-direction).  
3. Demonstrate usage of `flex-auto`.  
   - [Docs: flex-auto](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/flex#auto).  
4. Demonstrate usage of `flex-none`.  
   - [Docs: flex-none](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/flex#none).  

### Advanced task

1. Use **PostCSS** to minify CSS files.  
   - [Docs: Optimizing for production](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production).
