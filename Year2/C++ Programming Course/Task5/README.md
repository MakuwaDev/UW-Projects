# `Binder` - A Copy-on-Write Notebook Container

## Short task summary/translation:

This project implements a `binder` class template, a structured notebook system designed for organizing and sharing study notes efficiently. It supports **copy-on-write (COW)** semantics, ensuring memory efficiency while allowing modifications without affecting shared copies.

## Class Template Definition

```cpp
  namespace cxx {
  template <typename K, typename V> class binder;
}
```
- `K` (key) represents a unique **bookmark** for each note and must support **copying, moving, assignment, and ordering.**
- `V` (value) stores the **note content** and must have a **public copy constructor and destructor.**
