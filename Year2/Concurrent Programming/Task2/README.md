# Computational Verification of a Combinatorial Hypothesis

## Short task summary/translation:

We are interested in pairs of *multisets* of natural numbers with certain properties.
- For a multiset **A**, we denote **∑A** as the sum of its elements.
- Two multisets **A**,**B** are called `uncontestable` if:
  - **∑A**=**∑B**,
  - and the only subset pairs **A′**⊆**A**,**B′**⊆**B** with equal sums are the trivial ones: both empty, or both equal to the full sets.
- For a fixed parameter d≥3, multisets must be **d-bounded** (i.e., all elements between 1 and d).
